# Ombient

Ombient is an ambient music creation web application that allows users of any musical ability to interactively create and experience the calming effects of ambient sounds. This project was developed as part of my capstone for the software engineering bootcamp.

## Overview

Ombient enables users to interact with a visual representation of chakras to manipulate sounds associated with each. The goal is to provide a therapeutic and creative outlet for users to explore musical creativity without needing any prior musical knowledge.

## Features

- **Interactive Chakras**: Users can click on different chakras to initiate sounds, each tied to specific musical tones that evoke different moods.
- **Dynamic Sound Control**: Incorporates features like volume control, sound modulation, and reverb effects to enrich the user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **User-Driven Sound Exploration**: Each interaction by the user generates a unique sound experience, promoting repeated engagement.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js for the UI.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js for handling API requests.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user preferences and settings (if applicable).
- **Audio Processing**: Tone.js for sound synthesis and manipulation.
- **Styling**: CSS and potentially Styled Components for visual design.

## API Usage

The project utilizes the Tone.js library to handle all aspects of audio synthesis. While there is no external API for sound, the application's structure allows for easy integration if expansion is desired.

## Running Tests

Currently, tests cover basic functional checks:

```bash
npm run test



```
